Here's a fun and tasty recipe that you can make:\n\n#### Fairy Toast\n\nMaterials: Bread, Butter, Sugar, Cinnamon, Jam, Knife, Bowl, Spoon, Microwave (optional), toaster\n\n1. Toast the bread to your desired crispness.\n2. Spread a thick layer of butter on the toast. Don't be shy! \n\nThis will act as the glue for the sugar crust.\n3. Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. You can decide how much of each you would like, but start with a ratio of 3:1 sugar to cinnamon ratio so the cinnamon isn't too overpowering. \n\n4. Sprinkle this mixture on the buttered bread thickly. \n\nThis is the best part for kids, so encourage them to use a lot!\n5. Heat up the jam in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave (if you're unsure about using the microwave, use a saucepan on the stove instead) for 30 seconds until it's smooth and runny. \n\n6. Now pour this magical, sweet liquid all over the cinnamon and sugar covered toast. \n\nAs it runs down the sides and pools onto the plate, it will magically change colors and look amazing!\n\n7. Enjoy your fairy toast! If you want to be EXTRA, top with some fairy dust (sparkling sugar) for an extra magical experience. \n\nKids love making this recipe, and the end result is delicious! Plus, it's versatile, so everyone can customize their toast to their liking. \n\nBest of all, it's fun to make and brings a bit of magic to a regular old breakfast. \n\nHappy cooking! Is there anything else I can help you with?" },
